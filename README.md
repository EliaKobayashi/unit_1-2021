# Unit 1: A classic game 
![](game.gif)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre. 

## Personal Problem Definition.

Ever since I was little, I would watch the Champions League with family and friends anually. It was a competition that would bring people together with so much joy and excitement. Even if my favorite team could never win, I had a lot of fun watching the tournament. Thus, I wanted to turn all this nostalgia, joy, and excitement into a game. Additionally, I have seen many text-based games that are focused on mystery or survival. However, it is extremely rare to find a text-based game for football. Hence why I decided to create a football game based on the Champions League.

# Proposed Solution

![](repo_pic.png)

## Success Criteria

1. The game will calculate how well a user did in the game based on their rating.
2. It must validate user inputs.
4. The game will be a career mode video game based on the champions league. Meaning, the user will become a professional football player and play in the Champions League in the game. 
6. The video game save the rating, time spent, and username of a user.
7. The user will have a rating which can be improved based on their proformances in matches.
8. The game will be available in English and Japanese.

## Design Statement

I will design and make a classic video game for a client who is looking for a text-based video game with a record of player names and scores. The theme of the video game is football and is constructed using the software python 3.x. It will take a month to make and will be evaluated according to the success criteria mentioned prior.

## Justification

For this game, I will be using python which is, according to statisticstimes.org, the most used coding language in the world and the language I am most comfortable using. Additionally, according to cisin.com, Python is the most versatile language in the world. My text-based game will be coded on the MacOS system and on a Python editor called "PyCharm". Pycharm was chosen as it is simple and easy to code on. Furthermore, it is very easy to store files in. As the client did not have many requirments, I was free to pick my own theme and structure if it met the three requests.

## Details

My game, "Champions League Career", will be a text-based game that will allow users to play a Champions League tournament with real teams. The game will include a randomisation of the tournament bracket to ensure the game will differ each time the user plays. Furthermore, the games the user doesn't play will be simulated. The game will consist of decisions that have to be made by the users that will affect the outcome of a match. To win the game, one has to win every match and win the tournament. If one loses a match, it will be game over and they will have to replay the game. Each match will contain three to four decision points. Each decision point throughout the game differ from each other. The game will save the user's username, rating, and time spent on the game. Therefore, if the user were to play the game again, they can look at their previous score. 

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

![](system_diagram)

Figure 1. System diagram for the proposed solution.

As shown in Fig.1, the proposed solution runs on Python and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "Champions League Legend" has two inputs (1 and 2). Depending on the input, the output will differ in game situations.

## Flow Diagrams

Figure 2. Flow dagram of the entire game

As shown in Fig.2, the game will consist of a plethora of choices carried on by the users. Depending on the choices, the ending of the game will differ as well. Although Fif.2 does not contain all the details of the game, it contains the key elements.

Figue 3. Flow diagram of tournament bracket making

As shown in Fig3, the game will contain a bracket making system. This system will randomly place teams into each seed.

![](third_flowchart.jpg)

Figure 4. Flow diagram of encoder

As shown in Fig. 4, there will be an encoder at the end of the game to store the data of the users in a manner which is safe. If the file is leaked, the encoder will ensure that no one is able to find personal details about the users.
