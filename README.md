![](game.gif)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre. 


## Proposed Solution

I will design and make a classic video game for a client who is looking for a text-based video game with a record of player names and scores. The video game will about football and is constructed using the software python It will take a month to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ____.

## Success Criteria

1. If the ranking table contains username, score, and is able to properly rank based on scores, it can be deemed successful.
2. It must validate user inputs.
4. The game will be a career mode video game based on the champions league. Meaning, the user will become a professional football player and play in the Champions League in the game. 
6. The video game will have a login system where the player can save their progress.
7. The user will have a rating which can be improved based on their proformances in matches.
8. The game will be available in English and Japanese.

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

Figure 1. System diagram for the proposed solution.

As shown in Fig.1, the proposed solution runs on Python and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "Champions League Legend" has two inputs (1 and 2). Depending on the input, the output will differ in game situations.

## Flow Diagrams
### Cesar's Cypher
The database in the game has to be protected so that personal data is not exposed. To solve this I am using the Cesar Cypher. **Fig 2.** shows that flow diagram for this function.
