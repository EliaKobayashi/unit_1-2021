As shown in Fig.1, the proposed solution runs on Python and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "Champions League Legend"

## Flow Diagrams
### Cesar's Cypher
The database in the game has to be protected so that personal data is not exposed. To solve this I am using the Cesar Cypher. **Fig 2.** shows that flow diagram for this function.
