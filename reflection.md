What do you understand about Comp Sci now that you didn't before?
I understand now that computer science is not all about coding. There are a lot more steps to it and there is quite a bit of writing to do as well. Additionally, I understood that in computer science making the code eleqaunt and legible is vital.

What do you now understand about yourself that you didn't before?
I understood that I can do a project more enjoyably if I don't procrasinate and I do little by little every day. 

What worked well and didn't work well for you during the development of Unit 1?
The coding worked pretty well and it was extremely fun so time flew by fast. However, the repository was hard as I wasn't sure what to put which took a long time. 

A developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree or disagree?
I disagree as a developer must be responsible for the safety of the people who use this code. If they create that people can use to harm others, it is on the shoulders of the developer. Much like nobel and dynamite. A developer must ensure the safety of the people who use it and the developer must ensure the longevity of the code for the client.
